1. Emily Leiby
2. I became interested in Data Science through my undergraduate studies. I took an introductory class, and I really liked it. I'm currently working as a Data Engineer at an IT asset management firm. 
3. I took two java programming classes for undergraduate degree. I also used R and python in two of my data science clasess. I don't currently use programming on the job, but I hopefully will in the future.  
4.  I took an introductory stats course for my undergraduate degree, as well, but I definitely need a refresher because its been awhile. I do not currently use stats on the job. 
5.  I have a little experience with python from my undergraduate, and I used R in DS700, which I took this past summer semester.
6.  I hope to have a better understanding of both python and R to use in future data science projects. I am working on building new capabilities for my team at work, so I think this could help a lot. 
7.  I'm currently living in Chicago. I love food, and I'm a Six Flags session pass holder. I hope to use either my interest in soccer or food as my topic for the final project.
